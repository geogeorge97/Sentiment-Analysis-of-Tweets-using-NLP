# Sentiment-Analysis-of-Tweets-using-NLP

Designed and implemented a sentiment classifier to classify tweets as positive, negative or neutral utilizing
Linear Support Vector Classifier (SVC); Obtained accuracy of 63% and f1-score of 60%. Tweets initially
cleaned using regular expressions to remove hyperlinks, URLs and unnecessary characters. TweetTokenizer
utilized as it handles emojis, hashtags and other elements of a tweet well. As sentiment of tweet is the only
point of interest, stemming is done instead of lemmatization
